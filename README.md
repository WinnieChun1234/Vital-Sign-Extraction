# Vital-Sign-Extraction

This is an individual project in the Artificial Intelligence in Internt of Things in my degree study. It aims to detect vital sign such as breathing rate and heartbeat through signal processing on channel signal information (CSI). 

The assignment comes with a data file. I have a few tasks on signal processing and the detailed results are written in the individual report.
